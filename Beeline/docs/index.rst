   Overview of BEELINE

This site serves as the documentation for the code released under the
**Benchmarking gEnE reguLatory network Inference from siNgle-cEll
transcriptomic data** (BEELINE) project.  The first part of this
project is the :ref:`BEELINE` pipeline which provides tools to
evaluate the performance of algorithms for the reconstruction of gene
regulatory networks (GRNs) from single-cell RNAseq data. The second
part of this project is :ref:`BoolODE`, a tool to automatically
convert a Boolean model to an ODE model, and subsequently carry out
stochastic simulations.
