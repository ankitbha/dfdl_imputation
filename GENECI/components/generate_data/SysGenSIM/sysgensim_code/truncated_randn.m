function ret = truncated_randn(m,s,lb,ub,dims)
%truncated_randn Pseudorandom numbers from truncated normal distribution.
%   truncated_randn(M,S,LB,UB,DIMS) returns an array of dimensions DIMS
%   containing pseudorandom values drawn from the truncated normal
%   distribution with mean M, standard deviation S, lower bound LB and
%   upper bound UB.
