% [SCC,SCC_heights] = network_condensation(A)
%
% This function, given a non-acyclic network, yields its condensed version.
%
% The input variable is:
% - A (matrix representing the gene network)
%
% The output variables are
% SCC         cell containing the indices of the nodes belonging to the
%             strongly connected components
% SCC_heights height of each SCC
